Mechania is a unique realm consisting of distinct worlds filled with custom mobs, generation, and gameplay mechanics, all intertwined with the vast concepts of magic and technology - in basic language, this is an adventure/survival public server powered by data packs and plugins.

### How can I play Mechania?
Mechania is still in quite early development. We are trying very hard to complete it as soon as possible, but it still means that you'll have to wait a while (at least until Minecraft 1.14 comes out) for release. As soon as it is polished like a good block of andesite, it will be free-to-play.

### How can we help?
The easiest way to give help and feedback would be to give us a message in the [#suggestions](https://discordapp.com/channels/475107516330541057/527959338434822154) channel in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/dwBDrp3). Expect a response within a few hours! Additionally, you can visit Mechania's [Minecraft Forum post](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/servers-java-edition/server-recruitment/2919839-mechania-a-magical-and-technological-adventure) to apply for a developer position.
