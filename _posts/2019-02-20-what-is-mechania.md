Mechania is a unique realm consisting of distinct worlds filled with custom mobs, generation, and gameplay mechanics, all intertwined with the vast concepts of magic and technology - in basic language, this is an adventure/survival public server powered by data packs and plugins.

### How can I play Artefact?
Mechania is still in quite early development. We are trying so hard to get it complete as soon as possible, but it still means that you'll have to wait a while for release. As soon as it is polished like a good block of andesite, it will be free-to-play.

### How can we help?
The easiest way to give help and feedback would be to give us a message in the [`#suggestions`](https://discordapp.com/channels/475107516330541057/527959338434822154) channel in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/dwBDrp3). Expect a response in about up to a day!
